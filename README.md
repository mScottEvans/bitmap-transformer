# bitmap-transformer
Author: Jon Rumsey and Scott Evans

Build out the BitMap Class with the three instance methods, we were able to load a image file into a BitMap Class property.

We built out a app.java to accept an array of string arguments  to create an instance of the BitMap Class, 
also enabled selection of transformation method through input arguments.

Also created apptest.java with one test.

## How to Use

This project is a work in progress.. It will build and it will run but no transformations will happen.
